# Escape-from-Tarkov-like-inventory-system
Unity 3d experiments to create a Escape from Tarkov like grid based inventory system.

This is an experiment project completely made by me apart from the arms 3d models.
This project was made in 2022, here is a little video showing how it functions:

The goal for this was to experiment on how grid based inventories work and how they could be implemented.
The quality of these scripts might not be perfect and should be rewritten now that I know what im doing, but this project taught me alot about the subject.
You are free to use the scripts or take inspiration from the implementation.

Scripts are located Assets/Scripts/

If being completely honest, PlayerArmsScript is completely seperate experiments 
from the inventory projects and if i remember correctly its not developed too far, 
so I would not borrow that script if I was you.
